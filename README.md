# Amelia-s-Balatro-Cyclops
What If Balatro was made by a cyclop? The Jokers themselves would be cyclops, for one!

# Yes, I spent one evening changing all jokers into cyclops
I changed __93__ out of 150 Jokers, to make them aligned with the enCYCLOPedia of cyclop looks (I made them all have 1 eye (well, technically just 0.98924731182795698924731182795699 eves, but that's unimportant))
__I hope you enjoy__
