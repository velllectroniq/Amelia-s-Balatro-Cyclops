# Amelia-s-Balatro-Cyclops
What if Balatro was made by a cyclop? The Jokers themselves would be cyclops, for one!

### Yes, I spent one evening changing all jokers into cyclops
I changed __93__ out of 150 Jokers, to make them aligned with the enCYCLOPedia of cyclop looks (I made them all have just 1 eye)

This Texture pack was made thanks to this amazing [texture pack template](https://github.com/emihead/balatro-texture-pack-template). Thank you so very much.

# How to install?
Just copy the amelia's_cyclops folder into your Balatro mods folder, and you're done
(You just need to remember that [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) is a __requirement__, not an option)

If you did everything correctly, you should get greeted by a cyclop Joker, and in the Steamodded mods configuration, you should see this:

### I hope you enjoy
